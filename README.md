Implementing Public Key Infrastructure for Document Security

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to enhance the security of internal documents for Wonderville Town Hall. The solution allows for the encryption and decryption of sensitive files, ensuring that they remain protected, even when accessed remotely by town employees.

## Background

Wonderville Town Hall has a small IT department that manages various software applications for the town. Due to recent concerns over cybersecurity breaches targeting municipal systems, the need for a robust document security solution became evident. This project aims to implement a PKI using self-signed certificates to secure internal documents.

## Technologies Used

- Windows Server (acting as a Certificate Authority)
- Windows 10
- Ubuntu Terminal
- Python (for HTTP server and scripts)
- RSA encryption with OAEP padding
- PowerShell
